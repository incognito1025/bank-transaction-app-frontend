Ah, I understand now! If you want to quickly scaffold out a basic React component structure in `App.jsx` (or any file) without creating custom snippets, you can follow these steps in Visual Studio Code (and many other editors support similar functionality):

1. **Using Extensions**:
   - Install an extension like "Reactjs code snippets" or "ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets". These extensions provide predefined snippets for common React components and patterns.

2. **Type a Trigger**:
   - In an empty `App.jsx` file, type `rfce` and press `Tab` (or `Enter`). This trigger will expand into a basic React functional component template.

3. **Result**:
   - After triggering `rfce` followed by `Tab`, VS Code will automatically generate the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      
    </div>
  )
}

export default App;
```

4. **Other Useful Triggers**:
   - `rcc` or `rccp`: Creates a class component.
   - `rpc`: Creates a pure component.
   - `rconst`: Adds a constructor to a class component.
   - `rcredux`: Adds a Redux-aware component.
   - `rctx`: Adds a context provider and consumer.

These snippets can significantly speed up your development process by providing boilerplate code that you can then modify according to your specific requirements.
